# Notes

- Reminder that this is a different context (installed app vs web browser)
- Needed to install Cordova geolocation plugin to get location
- Need location turned on device beforehand (add prompts to handle these scenarios somehow?)
- Location error messages different for Android/iOS compared to web, need to modify React code
- iOS has its own gotchas (server needed to be modified to handle preflight requests but was responding fine on Web/Android)
